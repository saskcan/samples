Note: read_yahoo.R is mainly copied from an example in the book 'R in a Nutshell - 2nd Edition' by Joseph Adler.

The included 'R' scripts are designed to test 'lookback' periods and 'expected returns' for stocks in the Dow Jones 30 index using data from Yahoo Finance. Modern portfolio theory is used and short sales are not restricted.

The script outputs the average return for the historical data based on test parameters as well as the standard deviation of returns. The Sharpe ratio is used to quantify risk.
